# resharper-fix-vb-keyword-completion

A super-simple plugin for ReSharper 7.1 to do just one thing: add the ``Then`` keyword to the code completion list shown after using the ``ElseIf`` keyword. See [this ReSharper bug report for more info](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-338938).


## How do I get it? ##

If you wish to just install a copy of the plugins without building yourself:

- Extract everything
- Run the Install-FixVBKeywords.7.1.bat batch file

## Building ##

To build the source, you need the [ReSharper 7.1 SDK](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html) installed. Then just open the src\resharper-fix-vb-keyword-completion.sln file and build.
